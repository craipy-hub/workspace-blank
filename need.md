Use vite+vue to implement a yaml or json configuration app, which can achieve the following functions:
1. Create a dict
2. Load a yam file or json file as a dict
3. Save the dict file as yaml or json
4. You can edit the value corresponding to each key in the dict, including nested keys
5. You can add keys (including nested ones)
6. You can delete keys
7. The ui includes a menu bar
8. The content in the ui includes two columns, the left column lists all the nested keys in the dict in the form of a tree, and the right column displays the value of the key, which can also be used to perform operations, such as adding keys or modifying keys and values, deleting keys, etc.
